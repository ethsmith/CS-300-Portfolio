# CS 300 Portfolio

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem I was solving in this class was how to develop solutions to coding problems using data structures, and how to use algorithms to boost the efficiency of the solutions. I went into detail on the different data structures and their associated algorithms as well as their runtime costs.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
Data structures are important to stand because they are not created equal. Each data structure has a different runtime cost for read, write, search, etc. This is why it is important to understand algorithms that will boost the efficiency of your work, especially when the amount of data being worked with is very large.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I used stack overflow and other coding websites that went into step by step detail on data structures and algorithms when I was stuck. It is important to know the resources available to you when programming. I was never stuck on an issue longer than five minutes because I knew how to research effectively.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
My work on this project helped me better understand the algorithms available to me when working in a real world environment. I already work professionally as a developer and this project helped me to understand places where I can go back and improve the performance of my work. This has helped me become more valuable to my current employer and future ones.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Although I was already writing pseudocode fairly often, I believe that I became better at it and reinforced the habit in my personal and professional projects. This will make my code much more readable and maintainable for the next developer to take my place at work.
